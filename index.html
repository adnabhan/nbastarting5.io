    <h1>Make Your All-Time NBA Starting 5!</h1>
    <p>Create the <b>GREATEST</b> Starting 5 EVER (well, from 2015-2022, hehe).</p>
    <p>Select a season and a team to display the players from that year. Then, select a player to see how much they costs.</p>
    <p>Add two guards, two forwards, and a center. <b>BUT</b>.....be wary, you only have $25 to spend!</p>

    <h2>Price Calculation</h2>
    <p>Prices are generated using season averages for the 5 major statistical categories: Points, Rebounds, Assists, Blocks, and Steals.</p>
    <p>By averaging the player's season averages across these categoreis (and rounding to the nearest $), we get our price</p>
    <p><i>Example: Player averages 25 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 blocks, and 1 steal, their price is $7.</i></p>
